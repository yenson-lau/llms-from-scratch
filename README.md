# LLMs from Scratch

Just a place for me to experiment with building LLMs from scratch!

For now it will largely be based off of

* [rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch)

I'm also going to be using the following tools:

* [Cursor IDE (experimental)](https://www.cursor.sh/) for editing code
* [uv (experimental)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for package management
* [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) for installing Python applications
    * This is what I'll use to install `virtualenv`, `uv`, and `pre-commit`
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for creating virtual environments
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for managing git hooks
